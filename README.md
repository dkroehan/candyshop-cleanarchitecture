# candyshop-cleanarchitecture

This is the demo repository for my talk about "Clean Architecture - A practical approach".

This project is meant to show concepts of the clean architecture approach.

It consists of a multi-module maven project that gives an idea of how to structure a project and how the dependencies between the modules look like.

Code can be found in the following modules:
- api
- core
- database

All other modules may be empty and are meant to give an idea for further functionalities.

Please note: This is currently no working service!
